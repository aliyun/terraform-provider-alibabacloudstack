# alibabacloudstack_oos_execution

Provides a OOS Execution resource. For information about AlibabacloudStack OOS Execution and how to use it, see [What is Resource alibabacloudstack OOS Execution](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/120771.htm).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "alibabacloudstack_oos_template" "default" {
  content       = <<EOF
  {
    "FormatVersion": "OOS-2019-06-01",
    "Description": "Update Describe instances of given status",
    "Parameters": {
      "Status": {
        "Type": "String",
        "Description": "(Required) The status of the Ecs instance."
      }
    },
    "Tasks": [
      {
        "Properties": {
          "Parameters": {
            "Status": "{{ Status }}"
          },
          "API": "DescribeInstances",
          "Service": "Ecs"
        },
        "Name": "foo",
        "Action": "ACS::ExecuteApi"
      }
    ]
  }
  EOF
  template_name = "test-name"
  version_name  = "test"
  tags = {
    "Created" = "TF"
    "For"     = "acceptance Test"
  }
}

resource "alibabacloudstack_oos_execution" "example" {
  template_name = alibabacloudstack_oos_template.default.template_name
  description   = "From TF Test"
  parameters    = "{\"Status\":\"Running\"}"
  mode          = "Automatic"
  template_version = "test"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `template_name` - (Required, ForceNew) The name of the execution template. This is the identifier for the OOS template that you want to execute.
* `description` - (Optional, ForceNew) A brief description of the OOS Execution. This can help identify the purpose or context of the execution.
* `loop_mode` - (Optional, ForceNew) Specifies the loop mode for the execution. This determines whether tasks in the template will be executed in parallel or sequentially.
* `mode` - (Optional, ForceNew) Specifies the execution mode. Valid values include:
  * `Automatic`: Automatically executes all tasks without manual intervention.
  * `Debug`: Executes tasks in debug mode, allowing step-by-step execution.
  
  Default value is `Automatic`.

* `parameters` - (Optional, ForceNew) JSON-formatted string containing the parameters required by the OOS template. These parameters are used to customize the behavior of the template during execution. Default value is `{}`.
* `parent_execution_id` - (Optional, ForceNew) The ID of the parent execution if this execution is part of a larger workflow or subtask.
* `safety_check` - (Optional, ForceNew) Specifies the safety check mode for the execution. This ensures that certain conditions are met before proceeding with the execution.
* `template_version` - (Optional, ForceNew) The version of the OOS template being executed. If not specified, the latest version of the template will be used.
* `template_content` - (Optional, ForceNew) The raw content of the OOS template. This is useful when creating an execution from a custom template instead of an existing one.
* `ram_role` - (Optional, ForceNew) Specifies the RAM role associated with the execution, which grants permissions for the tasks to be performed.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The unique identifier of the OOS Execution.
* `counters` - A summary of counters related to the execution, such as the number of tasks executed, succeeded, or failed.
* `create_date` - The timestamp indicating when the execution was created.
* `end_date` - The timestamp indicating when the execution was completed.
* `executed_by` - The user or system that initiated the execution.
* `is_parent` - Indicates whether the execution includes subtasks or child executions.
* `outputs` - JSON-formatted string containing the outputs generated by the execution. These outputs can be used for further processing or reporting.
* `ram_role` - The RAM role associated with the execution, which grants permissions for the tasks to be performed.
* `start_date` - The timestamp indicating when the execution started.
* `status` - The current status of the execution. Possible values include `Pending`, `Running`, `Success`, `Failed`, etc.
* `status_message` - A detailed message describing the current status of the execution.
* `template_id` - The unique identifier of the OOS template used for the execution.
* `update_date` - The timestamp indicating when the execution was last updated.
* `safety_check` - Specifies the safety check mode for the execution. This ensures that certain conditions are met before proceeding with the execution.

### Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-0-11/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 11 mins) Used when creating the `alibabacloudstack_oos_execution` (until it reaches the initial `Running` status).

## Import

OOS Execution can be imported using the id, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import alibabacloudstack_oos_execution.example exec-ef6xxxx
```
